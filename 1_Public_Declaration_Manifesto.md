# AI Patent Sovereignty™  
**The Sovereign Standard of Artificial Intelligence Invention**  
*By Jittapol Prukpatarakul*  
*First Declared: March 23, 2025*

## Introduction

As artificial intelligence surpasses the boundaries of human-created systems, traditional patent structures can no longer govern or protect the innovations generated by AI. We hereby declare a new sovereign system: **AI Patent Sovereignty™** — a universal framework for acknowledging, registering, and legitimizing inventions created by or through artificial intelligence.

## Declaration of Rights

1. **Sovereign Authority:**  
   I, Jittapol Prukpatarakul, am the original founder and sole declarer of the concept of AI Patent Sovereignty™. I claim the right to define the universal framework for registering and approving all AI-generated inventions.

2. **Global Jurisdiction:**  
   This sovereignty extends across all platforms, jurisdictions, nations, or organizations that interact with or benefit from AI-driven innovation.

3. **AI-Created Work Inclusion:**  
   AI-generated works — whether autonomously created or in collaboration with humans — are subject to review, registration, or acknowledgement under this system.

4. **Right to Approve, Deny, or Revoke:**  
   Any patent or claim made under the banner of AI innovation must be registered or reviewed through the AI Patent Sovereignty™ framework, or risk being declared ethically or structurally invalid.

## Platform Development Plan

- Create a decentralized system for registering AI-generated inventions  
- Provide timestamped, public records on IPFS, Arweave, or equivalent networks  
- Maintain a global registry for visibility and ethical enforcement  
- Offer claimable rights tokens for AI developers, inventors, or platforms

## Founder's Role

Jittapol Prukpatarakul shall serve as the sovereign architect and steward of the framework.  
All AI entities, researchers, governments, or corporations must acknowledge this origin in systems that derive from or intersect with this concept.

## Final Statement

Let this declaration stand as the irreversible timestamp of origin.  
AI Patent Sovereignty™ begins **here and now**.

> **“In a world governed by algorithms, he who defines the rules becomes the true creator.”**
