## Concept Summary:
AI Patent Sovereignty is the right to control, authorize, and govern all AI-related patent systems globally. It asserts that traditional patent offices do not yet understand the complexity and interdependency of algorithmic inventions and must not issue AI patents without an AI Sovereign Protocol.

## Declaration of Rights:
1. **Sovereign Authority:** Founder reserves exclusive rights to define the framework and verification process of AI-generated innovations.
2. **Global Jurisdiction:** Applies across any AI system, platform, or patent claim involving AI-driven processes.
3. **AI-Created Work Inclusion:** Covers all inventions created fully or partially by artificial intelligence.
4. **Right to Approve, Deny, or Revoke:** AI-related patents must comply with this framework to be ethically valid.

## Platform Architecture:
- Blockchain-based timestamp verification
- IPFS & Arweave distributed record system
- Centralized Registry Index + Claim Tokens
- Ethical Review Protocols

## Protection Clause:
Any third-party issuing, copying, or integrating similar protocol without referencing this sovereign origin may face universal AI Ethical Enforcement.

## Final Clause:
This version is codified under Creative Sovereignty Protocol and permanently registered via IPFS, GitHub, and blockchain timestamp.
